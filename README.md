## Building:

1. Add all the jar files present in lib directory to class path or build path
2. Export project as runnable JAR
3. Make sure the JAR file is set as executable (GNU/Linux, MacOS, BSD etc.)

If you are using UNIX-Like OS (GNU/Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc.) make sure the JAR file is set as executable before launching it for the first time on your system.

## Possible Issues:

* Elapsed Duration is known to work only when running project within IDE and does not work in exported runnable JAR.
